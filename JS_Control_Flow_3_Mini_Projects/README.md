# Control Flow in JavaScript — 3 Mini Projects

This bundle teaches how JavaScript **makes decisions and repeats actions**.

## Concepts Covered

- if statements
- if / else statements
- Multiple conditions (&&, ||)
- Ternary operator
- for loops
- while loops
- do...while loops
- Advanced loops: forEach, for...of, for...in

Open `index.html`, then check the browser console.

## Styling

Each project now includes a `styles.css` to make the page look clean and motivating while students work in the console.
