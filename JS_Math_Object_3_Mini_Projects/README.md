# JavaScript Math Object — 3 Mini Projects

This bundle is designed to help beginners **understand and use the JavaScript `Math` object** through small, practical mini projects.

The Math object provides built-in tools for working with numbers — such as rounding, comparing values, generating random numbers, and performing basic mathematical operations — all of which are extremely common in real-world applications.

These projects focus on **logic and reasoning with numbers**, not advanced math.

---

## Overview

In this project bundle, you will work through **three mini projects** that demonstrate how to use the JavaScript `Math` object to:

- Control how numbers are rounded
- Compare multiple numeric values
- Perform exponent and root calculations
- Generate random values for dynamic behavior

All projects are **console-based**, allowing you to focus on understanding calculations before connecting them to UI elements.

## Topics Covered

## Rounding Numbers

You will practice using:

- `Math.round()` → rounds to the nearest whole number
- `Math.floor()` → rounds DOWN to the nearest whole number
- `Math.ceil()` → rounds UP to the nearest whole number

**Why this matters:**  
Rounding is essential when working with:

- Prices
- Scores
- Measurements
- User-friendly outputs

Different rounding methods exist for different situations.

---

## Comparing Numbers

You will learn how to use:

- `Math.max()` → finds the largest value
- `Math.min()` → finds the smallest value
- `Math.abs()` → converts negative numbers into positive values

**Why this matters:**  
Comparing numbers is critical for:

- Determining limits
- Finding best/worst values
- Handling distances and differences safely

---

## Exponents & Roots

You will practice:

- `Math.pow()` → raises a number to a power
- `Math.sqrt()` → finds the square root of a number

**Why this matters:**  
These operations are used in:

- Calculations
- Animations
- Game logic
- Performance and scaling formulas

---

## Random Numbers

You will learn how to use:

- `Math.random()` → generates a random number between 0 and 1

You will also practice **controlling randomness**, such as:

- Creating random whole numbers
- Setting minimum and maximum ranges

**Why this matters:**  
Random numbers are used in:

- Games
- Simulations
- Shuffling data
- Random selections and effects

## How to Use This Project

1. Open any `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Open DevTools:
   - Right-click → Inspect
   - Go to the **Console** tab
3. Follow the instructions inside each mini project.
4. Observe the output in the console.
5. Modify values and re-run the code to see how results change.

> These projects intentionally avoid UI so you can focus on understanding numeric logic.

## Learning Checkpoints

By the end of this bundle, you should be able to:

- Choose the correct rounding method for a situation
- Compare multiple numbers safely and accurately
- Perform basic exponent and root calculations
- Generate random numbers within a specific range
- Explain when and why to use the Math object

If you can explain the _reason_ behind each Math method, you understand it.

Happy coding 🚀
