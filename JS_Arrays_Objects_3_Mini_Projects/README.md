# Arrays & Objects — 3 Mini Projects

This bundle is designed to help beginners **understand how arrays and objects work in JavaScript** through small, focused practice projects.

Arrays and objects are the **foundation of data in JavaScript**. Almost everything you build — apps, APIs, UI state, user data — relies on these two structures.

These projects focus on **understanding how data is stored, accessed, updated, and transformed**, not just memorizing syntax.

---

## Overview

In this project bundle, you will work through **three mini projects** that focus on:

- Storing multiple values using arrays
- Representing structured data using objects
- Modifying, looping, and transforming data
- Understanding common patterns used in real-world JavaScript

All projects are **console-based** so you can focus on logic and data flow before introducing UI complexity.

## Topics Covered

## Arrays

### Declaring Arrays & Using `.length`

You will practice:

- Creating arrays
- Counting how many items an array contains using `.length`

**Why this matters:**  
Arrays allow you to store multiple related values in a single variable.  
Knowing the size of an array is essential for loops and conditions.

---

### Reading & Updating Array Values by Index

You will learn how to:

- Access specific items using their index
- Update values at a specific position

**Why this matters:**  
JavaScript arrays are index-based. Understanding how indexing works is critical for manipulating data safely and predictably.

---

### Array Methods (Core Manipulation)

You will practice using:

- `push` → add an item to the end
- `pop` → remove the last item
- `shift` → remove the first item
- `unshift` → add an item to the beginning
- `splice` → remove or insert items at specific positions

**Why this matters:**  
These methods are used constantly in real projects to manage lists such as:

- Tasks
- Users
- Messages
- Products

---

### Array Transformation Methods

You will practice:

- `map` → transform each item into something new
- `filter` → keep only items that match a condition

**Why this matters:**  
These methods help you write **clean, readable, and modern JavaScript**.  
They are essential for working with APIs, UI rendering, and data filtering.

---

## Objects

### Declaring & Manipulating Objects

You will learn how to:

- Create objects with key–value pairs
- Access and update values using:
  - Dot notation
  - Bracket notation

**Why this matters:**  
Objects represent real-world entities like users, products, settings, and profiles.  
Understanding objects is essential for working with structured data.

---

### Looping Through Objects with `for...in`

You will practice:

- Iterating over object keys
- Accessing values dynamically inside a loop

**Why this matters:**  
This allows you to inspect, display, or transform object data when you don’t know all the keys ahead of time.

---

## How to Use This Project

1. Open any `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Open DevTools:
   - Right-click → Inspect
   - Go to the **Console** tab
3. Follow the instructions inside each mini project.
4. Observe the console output after each step.
5. Modify values and re-run the code to see how the data changes.

> These projects intentionally avoid UI so you can focus on understanding data structures and logic.

---

## Learning Checkpoints

By the end of this bundle, you should be able to:

- Explain what an array is and when to use one
- Explain what an object is and when to use one
- Add, remove, and update items in an array
- Transform arrays using `map` and `filter`
- Access and update object properties confidently
- Loop through object properties using `for...in`

If you can explain _why_ you chose an array or object, you understand it.

Happy coding 🚀
