# Project 1 — Color Breakpoints (Background Color Example)

**Goal:** Change background colors at different screen widths using media queries.

You’ll practice:

- `@media (max-width: ...)`
- `@media (min-width: ...)`
- Understanding breakpoints like 480px / 768px / 1024px

# Project 2 — Responsive Typography Card

**Goal:** Make font sizes, line height, and spacing adjust for mobile vs desktop.

You’ll practice:

- `font-size` changes across breakpoints
- `line-height` and spacing changes
- keeping text readable on small screens

# Project 3 — Responsive Layout + Image

**Goal:** Build a section that is:

- stacked on mobile (image on top, text below)
- side-by-side on desktop (image left/right, text next to it)

You’ll practice:

- switching `flex-direction` with media queries
- using responsive image rules (`max-width: 100%`, `height: auto`)
- layout spacing changes across breakpoints

## Breakpoint cheat sheet (simple)

- **Mobile:** up to ~480px
- **Tablet:** ~481px to ~768px
