/*
  🧠 Project 3 — Responsive Pricing Cards 

  IMPORTANT RULES:
  - After each step: SAVE → REFRESH.
*/

/* STEP 1 — Base styling + readable page layout */
/*
  Style body and .page (margin:0, font-family, background).
  Give .page a max-width and center it with margin: 0 auto.
  This is just so the layout looks clean.

/* STEP 2 — Make the pricing container a flex row */
/*
  Select .pricing and set display: flex.
  Add gap so cards have spacing.
  At this moment, cards will try to stay in one row.
*/

/* ✅ WRITE YOUR CSS UNDER THIS LINE */

/* STEP 3 — Turn on wrapping (THIS is the key) */
/*
  Add flex-wrap: wrap to .pricing.
  Now shrink the browser width and watch cards wrap to the next line.
*/

/* STEP 4 — Make cards share space nicely */
/*
  Select .plan and set a flexible sizing rule.
  A common approach:
    flex: 1;
    min-width: 240px; (or 260px)
  This means: cards try to share the row, but will wrap if too small.
*/

/* STEP 5 — Alignments inside cards */
/*
  Inside each card, you can use flex too (optional).
  At minimum: style the button to feel consistent.
  Bonus: center text OR align content to top.
