# Project 1 — Flex Direction Playground (Row vs Column)

### Goal

Understand what happens when you switch:

- `flex-direction: row`
- `flex-direction: column`
- and also try `row-reverse` / `column-reverse`

### What you practice

- `display: flex`
- `flex-direction`

---

# Project 2 — Alignment Center Lab (justify-content + align-items)

### Goal

Visually understand:

- `justify-content` controls alignment on the **main axis**
- `align-items` controls alignment on the **cross axis**
  …and those axes change when you change `flex-direction`.

### What you practice

- `justify-content`
- `align-items`
- `gap`

---

# Project 3 — Responsive Pricing Cards (wrap)

### Goal

Build a mini pricing layout that:

- looks like a row on wide screens
- wraps nicely on smaller screens using `flex-wrap`

### What you practice

- `flex-wrap`
- `gap`
- consistent card sizing with `flex: 1` and `min-width`

## Tiny glossary (super beginner friendly)

- **Flex container**: the parent with `display: flex`
- **Flex items**: the children inside the flex container
- **Main axis**: the direction items flow (row = left→right, column = top→bottom)
- **Cross axis**: the opposite direction of the main axis

---

## Final checklist (for the whole bundle)

- [ ] You used `display: flex` in all 3 projects
- [ ] You tested at least 2 different `flex-direction` values
- [ ] You used `justify-content` and saw what it moves
- [ ] You used `align-items` and saw what it moves
- [ ] You used `flex-wrap` and confirmed it wraps on smaller screens
