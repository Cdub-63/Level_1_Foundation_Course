  🧠 Project 2 — Flex Alignment Center Lab 

  IMPORTANT RULES:
  - After each step: SAVE → REFRESH.
*/

/* STEP 1 — Base styling + visible stage area */
/*
  Style body and .page similar to project 1.
  Select .stage and give it a fixed height (example: 220px).
  Add a border or background so you can see the stage area clearly.
*/

/* ✅ WRITE YOUR CSS UNDER THIS LINE */

/* STEP 2 — Make the stage a flex container */
/*
  Select .stage and set display: flex.
  Add gap so chips have space.
  By default: flex-direction is row.
*/

/* ✅ WRITE YOUR CSS UNDER THIS LINE */

/* STEP 3 — Main axis alignment (justify-content) */
/*
  Add justify-content on .stage.
  Try values one by one to SEE the difference:
  - flex-start
  - center
  - flex-end
  - space-between
  - space-around
  - space-evenly
*/

/* STEP 4 — Cross axis alignment (align-items) */
/*
  Add align-items on .stage.
  Try values one by one:
  - stretch (default)
  - flex-start
  - center
  - flex-end
  Important: align-items moves items vertically (when direction is row).
*/

/* ✅ WRITE YOUR CSS UNDER THIS LINE */

/* STEP 5 — Flip direction and notice axes swap */
/*
  Set flex-direction: column on .stage.
  Now justify-content moves items vertically, and align-items moves items horizontally.
  This is the KEY flexbox concept to understand.
