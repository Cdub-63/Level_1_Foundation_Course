/*
  🧠 Project 1 — Flex Direction Playground 

  IMPORTANT RULES:
  - After each step: SAVE → REFRESH.
*/

/* STEP 1 — Base styling (so you can SEE the layout) */
/*
  Select body and remove default margin.
  Set a base font-family (system-ui is fine).
  Select .page and give it max-width + centered layout.
  Style .demo to look like a card (background, border, padding).

/* STEP 2 — Turn the container into a flexbox */
/*
  Select .box and set display: flex.
  Add a gap so items don't touch (example: gap: 10px).
  Refresh and notice: items line up in a row by default.
*/

/* STEP 3 — Control direction */
/*
  Add flex-direction to .box.
  Try these one at a time (comment/uncomment):
  - flex-direction: row;
  - flex-direction: column;
  - flex-direction: row-reverse;
  - flex-direction: column-reverse;
  Write down what changes for each one.

/* STEP 4 — Optional: center items (preview for next project) */
/*
  Try justify-content and align-items on .box.
  This is optional here, but it helps you preview the next project.
