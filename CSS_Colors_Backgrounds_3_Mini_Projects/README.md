# Project 1 — Color Badge Menu (Text Colors + Background Colors)

**Goal:** Make a tiny menu card where text colors show “meaning” (success/warn/error) and backgrounds make sections clear.

**What you practice:**

- `color`
- `background-color`
- simple contrast decisions

---

# Project 2 — Gradient Hero Banner (Gradients + Text Color Contrast)

**Goal:** Build a hero header with a gradient background and readable text.

**What you practice:**

- `linear-gradient()`
- picking readable `color` on top of backgrounds
- simple layout polish

---

# Project 3 — Background Image Playground (Image + Position/Size/Repeat/Attachment)

**Goal:** Use a background image and fully control how it behaves.

**What you practice:**

- `background-image: url(...)`
- `background-position`
- `background-size`
- `background-repeat`
- `background-attachment`
- layering images (optional): background pattern + hero image

## Quick glossary (super beginner-friendly)

- `color` → text color
- `background-color` → the color behind an element
- `background-image` → puts an image behind an element
- `background-size: cover` → fills the box, might crop
- `background-size: contain` → fits inside box, might leave empty space
- `background-repeat: no-repeat` → prevents tiling
- `background-position: center` → centers the image
- `background-attachment: fixed` → “parallax-ish” (background stays while scrolling)

## Final checklist (for all 3)

- [ ] You changed text color in at least 3 places
- [ ] You changed background colors on containers and small UI pieces
- [ ] You built at least one gradient background
- [ ] You used a background image with position + size + repeat controls
- [ ] You tested `background-attachment: fixed` and described what happened
