# Functions in JavaScript — 3 Mini Projects

This bundle is designed to help beginners **understand how functions work in JavaScript** through small, focused practice projects.

The goal is not memorization, but **understanding how and why functions are used** to organize logic, avoid repetition, and write cleaner code.

---

## Overview

In this project bundle, you will work through **three mini projects** that focus entirely on JavaScript functions.

Each project builds confidence with:

- Writing functions
- Calling functions
- Passing values into functions
- Understanding where variables live
- Recognizing common function patterns used in real-world code

All projects are **console-based** so you can focus on logic before UI.

---

## Topics Covered

### Declaring and Calling Functions

You will practice:

- Creating a function
- Calling (running) the function

**Why this matters:**  
Functions allow you to write code once and reuse it, instead of repeating the same logic everywhere.

---

### Functions with Multiple Parameters

You will learn how to:

- Pass more than one value into a function
- Use parameters as inputs

**Why this matters:**  
Parameters make functions flexible. The same function can produce different results depending on the values provided.

---

### Arrow Functions and Function Expressions

You will explore:

- Traditional function declarations
- Function expressions
- Arrow functions (`=>`)

**Why this matters:**  
Arrow functions are heavily used in modern JavaScript and frameworks like React. Understanding them early makes real-world code easier to read.

---

### Function Scope (Global vs Local)

You will learn:

- What global scope is
- What local (function) scope is
- Why some variables are accessible only inside a function

**Why this matters:**  
Scope prevents bugs and keeps code predictable. Knowing where variables exist is essential for debugging and clean architecture.

---

### Hoisting

You will observe:

- Which functions can be used before they are written
- Which ones cannot
- How JavaScript handles function hoisting

**Why this matters:**  
Hoisting explains many confusing beginner errors. Understanding it early avoids frustration later.

---

## How to Use This Project

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Open DevTools:
   - Right-click → Inspect
   - Go to the **Console** tab
3. Follow the instructions inside each mini project.
4. Run the code and observe the console output.
5. Modify values and re-run to see how behavior changes.

> These projects intentionally avoid UI so you can focus on logic.

---

## Learning Checkpoints

By the end of this bundle, you should be able to:

- Explain what a function does in your own words
- Identify parameters and arguments
- Predict console output before running code
- Explain the difference between global and local scope
- Identify which functions are hoisted and which are not

If you can explain it out loud, you understand it.

Happy coding 🚀
